We would like you to develop a simple app that will display some airport information.

The airport information is provided in the "airport.csv" file. The format is the following:
<airport-code>tab<time zone>tab<city>tab<state>tab<airport name>

We would like the app to:
1. display a list of airport names and timezones. The user can sort the airport by the name or the timezones. When sort by the timezone, group them by the timezone.
2. Select on one airport, show a new screen with all airport information.

Please use Swift for this assignment. Also explain the design patterns and assumptions you've made for the assignment in a text file.

You have two hours to complete your programming assignment and email the results back to recruiting@promptu.com. Alternatively, you may create a GitHub repository and send us the link.

We look forward to receiving your response shortly. Good luck!
